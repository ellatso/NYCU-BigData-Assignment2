# Schema

Every column of the 8 tables written by `preprocess.py`.

**Keys.** Every primary key (PK) is the row number 0, 1, 2, ..., and every foreign key (FK) holds the row number of the row it points to.

**Anonymization.** The preprocessing includes anonymization. The columns marked "code" or "masked" below are anonymized.

## Users

| column | type | key | description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `user_id` | int | PK | Row number 0..n-1 in time order; FKs pointing here hold this number (depends on the period you process) |
| `github_user_id` | int | code | Code of the original GitHub id of the user; the same in every period; this is `UserID` in test_input.csv |

| `is_bot` | bool |  | The username ends with [bot] |
| `is_cohort` | bool |  | One of the 9,000 cohort users whose own activity is collected. Other users only appear because a cohort user's activity references them (e.g. the author of a PR a cohort user reviewed), so their activity is incomplete; the test list contains cohort users only |
| `first_seen_at` | time | row time | Earliest event in your data that references this user |

## Repositories
